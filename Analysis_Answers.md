Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? (If you used any
   Python built-in functions, you can find their time complexities here:
   https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity )

2. Could you make your algorithm run in better time? If so, how?

3. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your
   implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. (Also remember
   that the size of the input array passed to the `heapsort()` function does
   _not_ contribute to the size complexity.)

   Most online sources say that the space complexity of heapsort is `O(1)`. What
   would we have to change in our code to get there?
