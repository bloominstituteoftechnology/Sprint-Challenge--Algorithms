## Exercise I Answer


'A' is logarithmic O(log n). The 'while' loop determines how many times N will be multiplied by with each loop.

'B' is linear O(n). I counted the number of for-loops by the number of operations within each loop. It is a nested loop. 

'C' is O(n). The if statement is constant, but the second return requires it perform additonal operations, making it Linear.


## Exercise II Answer

building = n
floorofbuilding = f


for f in range(len(n) - 1):
    if f > floorbroken:
        egg = broken

return f

The runtime complexity is: O(n)
