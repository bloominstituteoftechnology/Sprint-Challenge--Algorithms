Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) O(n) - Because the while loop runs the same ammount based on the input.
b) O(n^3) - The for loop runs 4 times based on the input.
c) O(1)

Exercise II:

1. Divide _n_ story building by 2. 

2. Drop an egg off that floor(_cf_). 
  2a ) If it breaks, go down _cf_ divided by the remaning floors below.
  2b ) If the egg doesn't break, go up from the _cf_ divide by the remaining floors above.
