Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
a) O(n)
b) O(n!)
c)O(log n)

Divide and conquer. I would find a middle point, drop the first egg there. Then if the egg break, I move to the middle of the bottom half. If it doesn't, I move to the middle of the top half. Repeat the process everytime to find the optimal floor
Run time complexity is O( log n)
