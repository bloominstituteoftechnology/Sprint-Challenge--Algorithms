Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
```
a) size of input triples  therefor =>  Quadratic Function O(n^c)
```

```
b) O(n^n) an operation increases in size as the size of the iterations 'n' increases.
```


```
c) O(n) since the time is directly proportional to the size of the functions input.
