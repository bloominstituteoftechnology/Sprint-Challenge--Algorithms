## Exercise I

a.

b. O(n^4) This example has four loops each one nested inside of the next. Each loop alone is O(n). So multiplying those: O(n) _ O(n) _ O(n) \* O(n) = O(n^4).

c. O(n) This is a recursive function that is running just like a loop. Because it's decrementing by one each time it's called, it is looping through all of the inputs.
