# Exercise 1

a) O(n) -- The runtime is O(n) because n stays the same while our variable a will go up at a linear pace.

b)O(n^4) -- The runtime is O(n^4) because we have 4 loops that go to n.

c)O(n) -- This recursive funtion is O(n) because it is like a for loop. And for loops are usually O(n).

# Exercise II

I would go to the middle of the building and drop an egg, if it breaks, I would then go halfway between the middle and bottom of the building, then drop another egg, if it doesn't break, I would go halfway up. I would keep going up or down depending on the new middle of the leftover floors until we get to the floor f where it will not break if the egg is dropped less than that floor and where it will break if higher than that floor.
