a) O(n^3 * n^2)

b) O(n^3)

c) O(1)

II) Split the index number of lfoors in half, and drop the egg from the middle floor. If it breaks, move on to the half of the smaller half of floors that was split before. Drop it from there, if it doesn't break, do the same thing to the larger half of that half, find the middle and drop from there. This would give you the least number of broken eggs to find the correct value for floor.
