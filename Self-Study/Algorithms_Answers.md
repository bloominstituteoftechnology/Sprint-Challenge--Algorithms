#Exercise I
a) setting a = 0 is O(1), a < n * n * n is O(n^2), a + n * n is O(n)
so it would be O(n^2) because it's the largest of the three

b) sum = 0 and sum += 1 would be O(1), we have three nested loop with n so it would be O(n*3)

c) This looks like a recursion I think it's O(n) because n is linear
