Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) O(n) - Because the while loop runs the same ammount based on the input.
b) O(n^4) - The for loop runs 4 times based on the input.
c) O(1) - The recursive function runs the same ammount of times directly related to the input and requires only one step.
