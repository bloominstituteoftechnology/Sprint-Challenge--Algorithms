'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
# add recursion 
def count_th(word):
    
    # TBC
    substr = 'th'
    
    count = word.count(substr)
    
    return count
    count_th(count)
 
   
    
    
    # pass
