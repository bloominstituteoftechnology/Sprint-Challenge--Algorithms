'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):
  #test = 'th'
  #if len(word) < 2:
    #return 0
  return word.count('th')
