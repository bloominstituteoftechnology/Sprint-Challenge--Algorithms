'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):
    #First we iradicate all instances of words that are not long enough
    if (len(word) < 2 ):
        return 0
    #Then we set the count
    count = 0 
    #Then we set it to recurse every two letters everytime it's called
    if word[0] == 't' and word[1] == 'h':
        count = 1
    count = count + count_th(word[1:])

    return count
