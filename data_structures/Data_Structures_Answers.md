Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
