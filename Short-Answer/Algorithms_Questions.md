# Analysis of Algorithms

## Exercise I

Give an analysis of the running time of each snippet of
pseudocode with respect to the input size n of each of the following:

```
a)  a = 0
    while (a < n * n * n):
      a = a + n * n

      
```


```
b)  sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      i += 1
      for j in range(i + 1, n):
        j += 1
        for k in range(j + 1, n):
          k += 1
          for l in range(k + 1, 10 + k):
            l += 1
            sum += 1
```


```
c)  def bunnyEars(bunnies):
      if bunnies == 0:
        return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
```


## Exercise II

Suppose that you have an _n_-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor _f_ or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor _f_. Devise a strategy to determine the value of _f_ such that the number of dropped eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode and give the runtime complexity of your solution.


def dropegg(n):

I would start from the bottom floor and throw an egg work my way up to the max floor. Whatever floor the egg is broken on is the value of the floor I would return.  If the floor the egg is being thrown off on is the max floor and the egg does not break it would return that none of the floors are breakable.

The largest complexity would be the while loop and there would be no nested loops. So the value would only grow as large is n is so the runtime complexity would be only 0(n)
