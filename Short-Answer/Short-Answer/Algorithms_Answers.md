#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) It appears time complexity is T(n) = 0 + T(n+1) which equals O(n), worst case is n = inf, best case n = 0

b) Two loops opertaing in one another indicate O(n^2)


c) O(n), where n is the number of time the recuesive funtion is called

## Exercise II

we can use a binary serach tree,
where the parent node = floor n/2
keys would be the floor, and will be inserted into tree
with a value that can represent true or false on egg breakge
we can then remove the right side of tree since it contain only floors with broken eggs

insert = O(h=n)
delete = O()
DFT to find floor with least number of drops
