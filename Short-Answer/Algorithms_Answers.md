#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) It's a linear complexity, O(n) since there is one input and output


b) It's a quadratic complexity, O(n^2) as the for while iterates n * the number of for loops. n * n


c) It's a linear complexity as O(n) the function is called recursively n times before it reaches its base case
