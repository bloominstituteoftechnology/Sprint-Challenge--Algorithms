#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n) - As n increases the rest of the constants lose relavance
    making n pretty much make or break the runtime.


b)  O(n^2) - In this function we would have to check for n twice,
    so*



c)  O(n) - this is a recursive funcion, but it runs linearly by 
    reducing until reaching bunnies = 0.

## Exercise II

n = number of storries
f = the hight at witch the egg breaks

# if n is higher than f, the egg should break

 while f is less than n           O(n)
     drop egg                     O(1)
     move up another floor        O(1)


total runtime = O(n)
