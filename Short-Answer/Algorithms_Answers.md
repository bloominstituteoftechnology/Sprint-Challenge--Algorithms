#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(1) because it is constant and doesnt matter on the size of the input.


b) 0(n^2), it has a nested while loop so as n increases so does the number of times it loops


c) 0(n) it is being called n times before reaching the base case

## Exercise II

1( run time 0(n)
2) English
    - if started at the top of n stories, if f=whatever it would recursivyl call until it hits the base case

    - n is total number of floors
    - f is the min level the egg will break
    - if floor is less than f, no break
    - if floor is greater that f , not break
