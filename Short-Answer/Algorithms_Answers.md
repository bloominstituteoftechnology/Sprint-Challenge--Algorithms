#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

(Linear) If the input is increased, the runtime will grow at the same rate


b) O(n^c)

(Polynomial) The run time will grow at a faster rate, (generally only good for small inputs)

c) O(log n)

(Logarithmic) The run time will grow at a slightly slower rate

## Exercise II

Find the middle of the array, (or middle floor) then drop an egg. If it breaks, eliminate the floors above as well as the one we're on. If the egg doesn't break, eliminate the floors below. Return to the new "middle" and repeat.
