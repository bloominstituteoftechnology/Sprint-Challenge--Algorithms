#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) this is O(n) its a has linear runtime becuase as "n" gets larger the rest of the constants don't matter and the calucation of "n" dominates the run time.


b) since this is a nested loop function and calucates "n" and "j" and since we know the runtime of each loop it is simply the largest of them so O(n^2)


c) this is a recursive function but it still runs linearly because it reduces (n-1) times until bunnies is 0 so it is still O(n)
