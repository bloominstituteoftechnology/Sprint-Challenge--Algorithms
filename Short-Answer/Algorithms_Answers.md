## Exercise I

a)
a)  a = 0
    while (a < n * n * n):  # the loop is based on n*n*n => O(n^3)
      a = a + n * n         # this makes loop go faster by n*n, we do multipliply first from PEMDAS
                        # the next while loop should see a + n * n < n * n * n
                        # dividing out the n*n results in a < n    
                        OVERALL complexity is => O(n)

b)


c)
