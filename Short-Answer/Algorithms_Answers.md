#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is O(n) because the dependence is placed only on the n, no matter the times it is run. To be put in other terms, when the input size increases, the runtime will grow at the same rate of the input.


b) This is O(n^2) because the first loop runs O(n) and the second loop would also run n times O(n).


c) This is constant O(1) because the runtime is unaffected by size of input.

## Exercise II

floor = O broken= False while is not broken; floor+= 1 if egg breaks we exit the loop and return floor -1. O(n)
