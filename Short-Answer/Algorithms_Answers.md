#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) linear time O(n)- because the input size will stay at the same rate the whole time. Which indicates linear.


b) Linearithmic time O(n log n) - because the j will continue to grow in the inner loop O(log n) even though the outer loop is linear.


c) linear O(n) - The function is recursive and will call itself 'n' number of times indicating linear. And adding 2 two the recursive call is also linear which is a constant time operation.

## Exercise II
