Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here:

a) a = 0
while (a < n _ n _ n):
a = a + n \* n

b) sum = 0
for i in range(n):
i += 1
for j in range(i + 1, n):
j += 1
for k in range(j + 1, n):
k += 1
for l in range(k + 1, 10 + k):
l += 1
sum += 1

c) def bunnyEars(bunnies):
if bunnies == 0:
return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
