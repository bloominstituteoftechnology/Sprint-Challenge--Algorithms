#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Running on O(n) and it's linear


b) Running on  O(n log n) 


c) running O(2) in recursive mode

## Exercise II

Binary Search
O(log n)

f 
e

n = floors
f = dividing floor (middle floor)

10 = didn't break
20 = did break
11-19  

Start at fllor 10 if it didn't break go to a higher floor say 20. If it breaks at 20 then we can check between 11-19 to see if it breaks.
