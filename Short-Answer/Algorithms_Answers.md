#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

This is a clear example of 0(n), we are utilizing the while loop to add an iterator that executes a sequence of statements this also executes the N times, we understand that it is being multiplied by each iteration.


b)

Clearly another while loop 0(n^2) that is nested , you will notice a curve in runtime as the numbers increase, in order for this to work we need to consider the iteration of inner and outer loops, we can also understand that each loop will produce a new number each time.



c)

This is clearly  and example of BigO 0(n) again, as this is a recursive function it will call itself (N) times.


## Exercise II

This is interesting, when thinking on the amount of eggs I would break so I would start on F floor, however, we can use 0(n) and this will allow us to iterate through each floor until an egg breaks.

We can also assume that we can use a BST if we are looking to limit the numbers of eggs we lose.

I can not think of any quicker way then to use a complexity of 0(log n), this is the way to go to solve this problem.
