#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) `O(n^3)`
    Because while the while loop is (`a` is less than `n^3`), the runtime scales by `n` cubed

b) **?** `O(2^n)`
    What is happening here is `j` is being multiplied by 2 `n` number of times so the runtime is `O(2^n)`

c) `O(n + 1)`
    The function will run as many times as there are `bunnies` passed into it (plus one for the 0 `bunnies` base case)
