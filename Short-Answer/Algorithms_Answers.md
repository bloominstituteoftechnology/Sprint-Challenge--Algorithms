#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This would be O(n^3) because it is dependent on the size of n. It has nothing to do with n*n*n because that's just the operation that is being ran. 


b) O(n^2) it is going through 2 different loops


c) O(n) it's iterating through n or in this case bunnies till it goes down to 0. 

## Exercise II

1) Divide the number of floors in half and throw out the egg.

2) If the egg doesn't break take number of floors from middle to the top split. Repeat step 1

3) If the egg breaks. Take the number of floors from 0 to the middle. Repeat step 1

In this scenario we would have O(log n) eggs thrown out the window
