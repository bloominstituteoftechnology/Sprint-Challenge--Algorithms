#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
0(1) because it will only run in a constant time to get a no matter how n changes

b)
0(n) because as n increases, j(initially 1) will need more run time to exceed n, which is also the run time of sum

c)
0(n) as number of bunny increases, the run time increases linerly
## Exercise II
start the test from the middle floor and see if the egg is broken or not. if it is move down to the lower half of the buliding and start test from the middle floor of lower half, if not move up to the higher half and start test from the middle floor of higher half.
