#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Single while statements causes O(n)

b)
Nested loops create (O(n^2))

c)
Single if statements that will eventually lead to 0 creates O(n)
## Exercise II

i = 0
while f == i:
    if egg= unbroken:
    i ++

    else:
    return i
this should be O(log n)
