#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n) - number of loops depends on n (runs relative to the value of n)


b) O(n log n) - first part is 0(n) since it grows at the same rate, but second part is doubling which makes it O(n log n)


c)O(n) - no loop to run through. dependant of bunnies

## Exercise II
Binary search - start in the middle floor and if the egg breaks, go to the middle floor between the middle & bottom, if it doesnt break, go to the middle of the top & middle floors. This would be O(log n) since we are diving in half.
