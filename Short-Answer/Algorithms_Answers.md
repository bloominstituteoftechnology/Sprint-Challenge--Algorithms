#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n), loop is dependant on n.


b) O(^2), nested for loop relies on the size of n inside of nested loop.


c) O(n), is calling a recursive function until it hits zero, this relies on the value of bunnies.


## Exercise II


Use a binary search where I start in the middle floor then drop an egg. if egg_broken = true, proceed half of remaining downward and repeat. If egg_broken = false (after drop) process half way upward remaining and repeat. This is O(logn).
