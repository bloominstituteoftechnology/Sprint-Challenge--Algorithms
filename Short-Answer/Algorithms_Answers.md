#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n)
There is only one loop so runtime is O(n) or linear run time.


b)O(n log n)
there is a while loop inside a for loop hence runtime is O(n log n)

c)O(n)
This is a recursive function 

## Exercise II

Binary search would be the best way to solve this problem
