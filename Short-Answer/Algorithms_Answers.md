#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Runtime 0(n^3) The code is running determined by how many times the loop will run n^3 = n_n_n As 'n' increases the result will increase also.


b)
Runtime 0(n log n)
The inner loop will increase as the value of n but, the outer loop has a runtime of 0(n) as the value of j doubles the value of n is being cut in half.

c)
runtime 0(n)
Determined by the amount of bunnies added to the function

## Exercise II
0 would obviously be the lowest point the egg could be dropped from because it is the lowest possible integer. Runtime complexity would be 0(1) becuase the algo would not be changed based on size of input (f)

Fn 1 could take a param that determines 'f' based on the input Within the fn there could be a conditional stmt for dropping the egg drop the egg ->, conditional stmt -> if breaks -> return true -> else -> return false

Fn2 could take f set it to 0 loop over a condiditonal drop the egg from current value of f if it doesnt break += 1 else return f -1
