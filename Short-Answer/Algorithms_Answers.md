#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)This example is an 0(n). The code will only run once time no matter the size of n is and will repeat once the loop starts. As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate.

b)There is a nested loop so O(n^2). I read in the Big O examples that O(n^2) represents an algorithm thats performance is exactly proportional to the square of the size of the input data.


c)This example is 0(n) due to the fact that recursion is being used and will run until the end. As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate.

## Exercise II

 - I would start thinking that this problem would have to have 2 different parameters; the egg and the floor.
 - If I am on the ground floor then no eggs would be broken.
 - If floor > g_floor then return the floor and a boolean if the egg broke or not: true or false
 - This would have a loop that returns true or false for the egg to see if it broke or not & the floor that it broke on.
 - This would most likely be 0(n) runtime but since we dont have set values or know how many times itll loop, its hard to tell.

This can be done as O(n)

def safeFloor(n)
dropped = 1
broken = false

while (broken == false AND dropped <= n):
    drop egg from dropped
    if egg breaks:
        broken = true
    else:
        dropped =+ 1
        
if dropped == 1
    return 0
elif dropped > n:
    return "Egg didn't break"
else:
    return dropped
