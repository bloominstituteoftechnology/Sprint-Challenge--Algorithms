a) O(n) b) O(n^3) c) O(n)

I would take half of n and drop an egg. If it breaks, then f is in the lower half. Repeat the process in the lower half of n. If it breaks then repeat the process. Continue until the egg doesn't break. Once it doesn't break, I would do the same thing on the upper half then lower or whatever it is to to find the real value of f.

O(log n)
