#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1)
constant time only does 1 operation


b) O(n2)
nested loop. For item that is in N we neeed to iterate through the inner loop

c) O(n)
if the input of bunnies increased the amount of times it will need to run the function to get to a solution will increase.

## Exercise II

(n) story
(n) eggs
!breaks < floor
breaks > floor

value of the floor will be determined by dropping eggs of the halfway point of (n / 2) stories
If the egg breaks then the user will find the middle point between that halfway point and the bottom
If not then the user will move up between halfway and (n) stories
this will continue until the user finds the value at which where the egg will break or not break
