Excercise I

a) The amount of steps increases as n is increased so it in linear so it would be O(n) 

b) There are 4 for loops and each loops makes n more complex with the exception of the last loop so on this case it would be 0(n^3)

c) bunnies represents n, the problem is similar to a in that it is growing in a linear fashion. even though it is recursive the recursing is acting as for loop that is looping until it reaches the base case. So 0(n)
