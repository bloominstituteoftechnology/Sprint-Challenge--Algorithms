#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) -> while loop runs O(n), constant operation inside, making it O(1), combined it becomes O(n)

b) O(n^2) -> for loop runs O(n) the inside while loop, checks in again and runs operation at O(n), because both checked n and need to be combined, O(n^2)

c) O(n) -> the function runs 1 operation based on the number ono bunnies, O(n)

## Exercise II

<!-- can we count the number of floors as we are going through? -->

mid = len(n) // 2:

go to a window on n // 2 floor, drop egg:
if_broken = True:
n[i:] = not_safe
find floor between len(n[1:i]) // 2:
repeat process
if_broken = False:
n[:i] = safe_floors

runtime -> logn
