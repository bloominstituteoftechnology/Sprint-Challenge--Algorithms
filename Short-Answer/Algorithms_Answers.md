#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because it's a single loop which depends on the size of the array

b) O(n^2) because it's a loop nested within a loop which makes it n \*\* 2

c) O(n) because it's recursive and is therefore dependent on our number of inputs

## Exercise II

One way to do it would be to use binary search which has a time complexity of O(log(n))

You can start at the halfway point in the building and drop an egg from there. Based on whether or not that egg breaks will tell you if you need to go up or down a floor. Repeat until you've reached the highest point possible without breaking an egg.
