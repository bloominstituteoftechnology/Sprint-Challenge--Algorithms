#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
o(n) because it runs n times

b)
o(n**2) because it runs n times with a nested loop

c)
o(n) because it's using recursive so it runs n times

## Exercise II
I would use merge_sort. I would divide the number of floors by 2.
Then I would then drop the egg. If the egg doesnt break , I would divide the floors in the right list by 2 again
and drop the egg and repeat until egg breaks.
If the egg breaks, I would divide the left side list by 2 and go to the that floor and drop the egg. If egg breaks , I found the floor. If not I repeat step.
It would be o(n) because I would use recursive.
