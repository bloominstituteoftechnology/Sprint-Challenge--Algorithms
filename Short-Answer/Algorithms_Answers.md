#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The runtime of this problem is O(2^n). It's a Exponential Time, because it's an increasing function as the input size get's larger.

b)
The runtime of this problem is O(n^2). It's a Quadratic Time, because it loops within the loop means it will print also double.

c)
The runtime of this problem is O(n). It's a recursive, but is based on the number of the elements.

## Exercise II

I would use binary search tree to solve this problem. The method will use Logarithmic Time O(logn) which means, it will have the access to the middle point, which can be called middle floor. By that, I can determine where my egg can break by halving to the top and do the same thing to find the minimum height where my egg breaks.
