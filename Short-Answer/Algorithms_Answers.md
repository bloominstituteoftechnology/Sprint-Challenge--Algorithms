#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n), Reasoning:
    Multiplication is nothing but addition n times.
    n * n is the same as
    n + n-1(n)
    The loop will only need to loop n times before coming to a conclusion. 


b) O(n/2) but we call it O(n) as it remains linear runtime relative to n times.


c) O(n) even though we're doing recursion, it still requires we create a recursive
    stack of size n, as we're linearly recursively diminishing the size of the passed
    in n by just 1 (n-1)
