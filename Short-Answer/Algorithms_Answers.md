## Exercise I

a) This process runs in O(n) time complexity. n^3 / n^2 is n. In this while loop "a" 
must be less than n^3 for the loop to run, but since "a" is being incremented by n^2 on every loop
we are left with the loop running only n times.


b) 


c) The run time of this function will be O(n). 
Since the function will run n + 1 times, we can ignore the + 1 and just say O(n)
