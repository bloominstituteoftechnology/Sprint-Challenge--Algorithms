#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) There is one while loop and it's multiplying n a few times. The Time complexity is always going to rely on the size of n


b) O(n**2) There are nested for loops. 


c) O(n) It's calling a recursive function until it hits zero.

## Exercise II

Use a binary search where I start on the middle floor and drop an egg. if the egg breaks, then I move to middle of the floors below and repeat. If the egg doesn't break, I move to the middle of the floors above and repeat. This would use recursion.

 O(logn)
