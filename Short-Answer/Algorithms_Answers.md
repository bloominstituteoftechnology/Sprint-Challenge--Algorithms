#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime complexity is O(n) because n is increasing linearly with a single step.


b) Runtime complexity is O(n) because even though there is a second loop, the second loop is not re-iterating over n, it is only using it as a comparison.


c) Runtime complexity is O(1) because you are returning a constant value and not looping over anything even if you are recursing a single time.

## Exercise II

Since we already know that the floors are a pre-sorted list, binary search would be the fastest because it will return in constant time.
