Exercise I:
a) O(n) linear increases with input
b) O(n^3) exponential look at the number of nested loops on input and the last loop doesn't count
c) O(n) recursion until the bunnies - 1 equals 0

Exercise II:

If floor is 0 ( on the ground ) no eggs are broken
if floor === 1, no eggs are broken
if floor > 1, return floor where the eggs would break

O(1) complexity
