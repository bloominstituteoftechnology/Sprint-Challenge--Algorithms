#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The `while` loop will run (n^3) / (n^2) times, which is equal to n times.
Therefore the time complexity will be O(n)


b) The outer loop will run n times, while the inner loop will run log(n) times.
For nested `for` loops, the time complexity is equal to n^x where x is the time
complexity of the inner `for` loop. 
Therefore the total time complexity is n^log(n)


c) The function will recurse n times because it is being decremented
by 1 each time until it reaches the base case. Therefore the time complexity
for this function is O(n)

## Exercise II

def max_drop(lowest_floor, highest_floor):

    # dropped floor is half way between highest floor and lowest floor
    dropped_floor = lowest_floor+highest_floor // 2

    # Check to see if the lowest_floor and the highest_floor are
    # the same value, indicating this is the final floor to check
    if(highest_floor >= lowest_floor):
        return dropped_floor

    

    # Drop the egg and determine if the egg breaks at the dropped floor
    broken = drop_egg(dropped_floor)

    # If egg does break, repeat this process but with the new lowest floor equal 
    # to the current lowest and the highest floor to the current floor, as we know
    # it cannot be dropped from any higher floor and survive, but could survive 
    # from a lower floor

    if(broken == True):
        return max_drop(lowest_floor, dropped_floor)

    # If egg doesn't break, repeat this process but with the new lowest floor
    # equal to the current dropped_floor and the new highest floor equal to
    # the current highest floor, as we know it could be dropped from a 
    # higher floor and still survive.

    if(broken == True):
        return max_drop(dropped_floor, highest_floor)

    # Repeat this process until the target floor is found and return it

## The runtime complexity is O(log n) because it mimics binary search and binary search has a runtime complexity of O(log n)
