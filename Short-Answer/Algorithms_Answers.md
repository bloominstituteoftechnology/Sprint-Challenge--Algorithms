#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n^3) The runtime of the while loop doesn't increase by the same integer each time n is increased. It increases by n^3 times.

b)
O(n^2). there is a loop within a loop and each loop increases by n which means that each loop has a runtime of O(n). O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)

c)
O(n). A recursive function that recurses once each call and by n-1.
