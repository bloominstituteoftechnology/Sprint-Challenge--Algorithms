Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) O(n).
    this is because the loop is dependent on the value of n. As the number of n grows we will have n operations within the loop.
b) O(n^4).
    this is because within the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens within the loop. O(n) * O(n) * 0(n) * O(n)
c) 0(2^n).
    this is because this is a recursive algorithm that is solving a problem of size n by recursively solving a smaller problem of size n-1
