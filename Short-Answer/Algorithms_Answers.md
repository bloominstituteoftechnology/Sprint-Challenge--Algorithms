#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime complexity is O(n) the while loop is running n times because n is run only once in the while loop and a is given an already saved value of n.


b) Runtime complexity of this is O(n^2) the code goes through the first iteration and then has to run a while loop, making it the second iteration of it running n


c)The runtime complexity is  0(1) It only checks to see if bunnies exist.

## Exercise II


Check to see if the egg breaks on the middle floor and if it does, then that is floor f, if not we continue our binary search maintaining a O(log n) complexity
