#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This one is a O(1). As the size of n increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a alil bit of a slowwer rate

b)This one is a O(n) As the size of the input increases, the space used will grow at a faster rate;

c)This one is a O(n) as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used is will grow at the same rate

## Exercise II

#Understanding
n-story building
many eggs

if egg is at floor x or at floor greater then floor x  
 then egg will eqaul to break

or elase if egg at is at floor less then floor x
then egg will equal to not break

#pseudo code

if eggs are thrown out x floor and break
then f is eqaul or greater x floor  
 otherwise if eggs thrown and do not break
then x floor is less than f
