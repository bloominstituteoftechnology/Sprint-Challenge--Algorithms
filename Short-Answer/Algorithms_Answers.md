#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) linear complexity, O(n) because there is one input and one output


b) Quadratic Complexity, O(n^2) becuase the for while iterates n * the number of for loops. n * n 


c) Logorithmic complexity, O(log n)
