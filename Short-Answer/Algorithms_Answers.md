#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
0(n) - code will run once no matter what the size of n is and will only repeat once the while loop starts - the code is linear

b) 0(n) - as the size of the input increases, the runtime will also increase at the same rate

c) 0(n^2) - a nested while loop will make 0(n) multiply by itself

## Exercise II

This algorithm would have two parameters: e for eggs, f for floor. On the first/ground floor, no eggs are broken. A while loop would determine that if f > floor then you'd return the floor and a boolean of true or false for the egg breaking.

Because we don't know how many times the loop would run, hard to determine runtime complexity. Probably 0(n)?
