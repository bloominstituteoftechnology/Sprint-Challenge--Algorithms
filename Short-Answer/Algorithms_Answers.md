## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity is O(n) since the while loop runtime will increase in a manner that is proportional to the size of input n. This is indicative of linear runtime.


b) The runtime of this would be O(n log (n)). The outer for loop would have a runtime of O(n) because it is dependent on the linear relationship of the input size of n. The inner while loop will have a runtime complexity of O(log n) due to the fact that `j` is incremented by doubling its value with each loop. The doubling would cause the loop to run in half the range of n. 


c) The runtime complexity is O(n). The only computation occuring is reduciing the number of bunnies by one with each recursive call.
