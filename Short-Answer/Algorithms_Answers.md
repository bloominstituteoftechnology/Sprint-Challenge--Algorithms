#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because the loop is dependant on the value of n.


b) O(^2) because the nested for loop relies on the size of n inside of nested loop.


c) O(n) because it is calling a recursive function until it hits zero.  and this relies on the value of bunnies.

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search where I start in the middle floor then drop an egg.  if egg_broken = true, proceed half of remaining downward and repeat. If egg_broken = false (after drop) process half way upward remaining and repeat. This is O(logn).
