#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) -- run time increases linearly as n increases. Single loop.


b) O(n^2) -- 2 loops. So run time increases twice as n increases. 


c) It is O(n) because the runtime will increase at a constant pace with the size of the input.
