#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^3): The n is the number of operations that the code has to perform and since n^3 is the largest operation out of the entire code block. 


b) O(n^2): With the use of the for loop the number of operations increases as the input size increases. 


c) O(n): This function is linear, recursion is used but that doesn't change the overall size of the operations.
