#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
n^3 but runs n^2 everytime reducing to n


b)O(n^2)
nested loops


c)O(n)
runs n times

## Exercise II


Go to middle floor drop egg
If breaks count out all floors above
Else if doesn't break count out all floors below
repeat process until lowest floor breaking egg is determined

would be Olog(n) cause steps are reduced as more floors are added
