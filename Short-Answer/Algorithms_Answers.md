#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n^3) -----> because n executes statements until a < n^3


b) Quadratic O(n^2) ----> because j executes n times and i depends on j (nested loop) so its time complexity is n * n


c) Linear O(n) -----> because statement executes until bunnyears function recursively calls n times.
