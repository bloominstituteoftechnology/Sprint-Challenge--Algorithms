# Answers to Short Answer Questions

## A: The first one appears to be linear, since the while loop will get bigger depending on what N is, the computations will not increase

## B: This appears to be O(N^2) since it has multiple nested loops and the computations will exponentially grow depending on how large n is. This is not efficient

## C: This is going to be 2^n since this appears to be the Fibonacci sequence, and the number of calls will increase as n increases since this is a recursive function.
