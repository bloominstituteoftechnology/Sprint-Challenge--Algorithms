## Exercise I

a) `O(n)`

The while loop runs until `a` reaches `n * n * n` which makes the while loops time complexity a `O(n^3)`. Everytime the loop runs, `a = a+ n^2` is executed. This makes this a time complexity `O(n^2)`. Now if we take `O(n^3)` and subtract `O(n^2)`, we'll get `O(n)`.


b)


c)
