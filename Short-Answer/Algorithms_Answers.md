#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n). The loop takes n iterations.


b)  O(nlog(n)) - The outer loop (for loop) is O(n), because it is executed n times. And the the inner loop (while loop) is O(log(n)), because
 its runtime complexity is half of n, due j*=2.


c) O(n). The recursion takes n times.

## Exercise II
