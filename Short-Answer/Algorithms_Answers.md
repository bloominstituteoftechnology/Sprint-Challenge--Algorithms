#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) runtime: O(n)  
Given n, it looks like the amount would double resulting a linear complexity.


b) runtime: O(n^2) 
Quadratic Time because it is a loop within a loop.


c) runtime: O(n) 
It is recursive, but called based on the number of elements.

## Exercise II


I would use a binary search, runtime complexity: O(log n). 

Using english for now, if there is time I will try to pseudocode it:
Start at the middle floor, drop the egg and if it breaks, move down to the next floor and test. If it didn't break we can move up to the next floor. Do this until you have it break on one floor, and stay intact on the one below it
