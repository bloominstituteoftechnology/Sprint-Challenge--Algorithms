#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) 
    O(2n) 1n for check and 1n for assignment, drop the constant and the answer is O(n)

b) O(log n) starts off as O(n) as it starts multiplying the iteration
    It becomes O(log n) once the loop gets bigger with the numbers


c) O(n) because it goes through check once -> O(1)
    O (1) for return 
        O (1) for second return and you get O(3n)
            which is O(n)

## Exercise II
    number_of_floors is n
    if number_of_loors is one
    return egg
    if number_of_floors n + one
    then return the broken egg

    runtime is O(n) fopr this operation
