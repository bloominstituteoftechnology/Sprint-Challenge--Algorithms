#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This algorithm would be O(n) or constant time


b) This algorithm would be O(n^3)


c) This algorithm would be O(n) or constant time

## Exercise II


To find the breaking point of the egg, we can check the median for breaking points

I would divide the number of floors in half, and drop the egg from that mid point. If the egg broke, I would divide the first half again, if it did not break I would divide the greater half. I would continue this until I no longer had multiple floors, which then should have narrowed down the list of floors to the breaking point of the egg.
As this would be similar to a Merge Sort, I believe the complexity would be O(nlogn)
