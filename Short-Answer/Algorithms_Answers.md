#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because it iterates from 0 to n^3

b) O(n^2) because there is another loop inside the base loop

c) O(n) it substracts 1 each time it iterates 

## Exercise II

check if the egg breaks when you throw it off floor f. if the egg breaks we will have to find the lower floors and try again but if the egg does not break we will need to find the higher floors

runtime complexity would be O(n) because we would have to keep iterating till there's no eggs left
