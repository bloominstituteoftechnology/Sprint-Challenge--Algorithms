#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) ``` a = 0
        while (a < n * n * n):
        a = a + n * n
        ```
        This algorithm runs in O(1) Constant Time


b) ``` sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      j = 1
      while j < n:
        j *= 2 sum += 1
        ```
        This algorithm runs in O(n) Linear Time


c)
