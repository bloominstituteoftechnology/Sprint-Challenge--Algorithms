#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - The number of operations is bounded by a multiple of n


b) O(n^2) - The inner loop's n relies on the parent loop


c) O(1) - Bunnies will remain constant

## Exercise II

floor f or higher = broken egg
Below floor f = unbroken egg

def value_of_f(n):
    number_of_dropped = n
