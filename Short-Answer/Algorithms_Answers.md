Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

A) This function is O(n^2) Since n will grow at this constant speed

B) This Function is O(n^3)

C) This function is O(n)


Exercise II:
Using recursion we would first have to first determin the size of the building to find the number of floors. Then we need to determin the max height at which the eggs won't break. And sort all of our Eggs into these floors to minimize broken eggs.


Since we would be working with a given number of eggs and a given number of floors which we would determin a max number, our time complexity would be O(n).
