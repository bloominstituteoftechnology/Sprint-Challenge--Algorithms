#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime = O(n). Exercise 1.a looks to be a linear as the function scales with the size of the given input.

b) Runtime = O(n^2). Exercise 1.b has a nested loop so I believe that would result in a n squared run time.

c) Runtime = O(n). Exercise 1.c also looks to be linear as we have no nested loops and our function is triggering a recursive call for every bunny input into this function.
