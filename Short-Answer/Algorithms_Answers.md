Excercise 1

a) O(n) because its linear and the amount of steps is increased as n is increased

b) O(n^3) as the loops require n, complexity grows with each loop except the last, in which n is constant 

c) O(n) same as problem a, the amount of steps is increased as n is increased


Exercise 2

create variable to determine if egg is broken or not 
start alg at first floor 
    while the egg is not broken, 
        drop the egg
        if egg is broken, store broken state, 
        else proceed to next floor 
O(n)
