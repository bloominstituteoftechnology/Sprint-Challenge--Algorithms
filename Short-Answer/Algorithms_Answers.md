#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
## A single operation


b) O(n log n)
## The nested loop depends on the size of n

c) O(n)
## This begins as a recursive function but there are only n operations.


## Exercise II
## My strategy would be to use a binary search.  I would drop and repeat from the remaining middle floor until I could determine the floor below F.
