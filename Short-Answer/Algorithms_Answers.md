## Exercise I

a)  O(n³) (n*n*n)


b)  O(n²) (j *= 2)


c)  O(n) (recursion)

## Exercise II


Search sorted floors by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the eggs are broken, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the floor is found.

O(Log N)
