Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

A) O(n) Linear time, Loop stops when a => n^3

B) O(n^4) - THis one is quadratic, three loops for n and one for k

C) O(n) Linear time again, calls itself until bunnies == 0. 


2)  Find the halfway point of _n_ story and start there, if egg breaks _f_ is lower, if it doesn't break then _f_ is higher. Repeat the process agaain for the halves until you find the _f_. This could be a binary search O(log n)
