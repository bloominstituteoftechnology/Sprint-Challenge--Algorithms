## Exercise I

a)O(n)

b)O(n^3)

c)O(n)


## Exercise II
So essentially in order to figure out what the value of _f_ is and minimize the number of eggs dropped it would half to be i believe a Binary Search. we would take half of _n_ and drop an egg. If the egg breaks then we can change the middle as the starting point, then we would go to the middle pointof that point which is now the middle point between the ground and drop another egg. Then continue the process, eventually a floor would be found where it does not break and the same can be done with the top half of the building.

Time complexity would be O(log n)
