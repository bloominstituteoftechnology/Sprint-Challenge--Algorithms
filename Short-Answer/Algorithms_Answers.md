#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I believe it would be constant so O(1)


b) I beleive it would be logarithmic so O(log n)


c) I believe it would be exponential so O(2^n)

## Exercise II

I would start at the bottom floor and start counting at 1 until I made it to floor f.
That way I would know the value of the floor under f.

I beleive it the time complexity would be linear so O(n)
