## Exercise I

a) O(n). The complexity of this code is linear since the number of iterations of the while-loop will be equal to the size of input. In other words, the steps required to complete the execution of this algorithm increase or decrease linearly with the number of inputs.

b) O(n^3) There are 3 loops with respect to the input n.

c) O(n). The complexity of this function is linear. We can see this just by testing the function with a range of numbers (for i in range(x)), the output increases linearly by 2.
