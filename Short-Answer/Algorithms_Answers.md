## Exercise I

a)This runs O(1) Constant Time


b)O(n) Linear Time


c)O(1) Constant Time

## Exercise II

Drop the egg from the middle floor if the return value is egg broke move to the current floor minus one and try again until egg is not broken
move to current floor plus one if the egg is not broken until value such egg is broke
when value hits egg broke move to current floot - 1 and return
O(log n)
