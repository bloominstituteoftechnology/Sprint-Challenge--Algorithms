#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) = The runtime complexity depends on the values of n


b) O(n^2) = the rutime complexity  is exponential due to the nested loop ( loop inside a loop). n* * n* = n^2


c) O(n) - The runtime compleixity will depend on the value of n
