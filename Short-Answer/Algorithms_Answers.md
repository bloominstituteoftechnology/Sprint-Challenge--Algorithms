#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) = the range for the while loop grows with the factor n^3 but 'a' is also growing with the factor n^2


b) O(n^2) = loop in a loop


c) O(n) = n doesn't influence the flow of the  algorithm.

## Exercise II

Take the middle point of the building: if the egg gets broken take the middle of the floors bellow if not take the middle floor of the floors above. Repeat untill one is left.

Runtime: O(log n)
