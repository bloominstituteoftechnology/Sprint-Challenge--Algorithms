# Instructions for robot problem

Inside the `robot_sort` directory you'll find the `robot_sort.py` file. Open it up and read through each of the robot's abilities. Once you've understood those, start filling out the `sort()` method following these rules:

* You may use any pre-defined robot methods.
* You may NOT modify any pre-defined robot methods.
* You may use logical operators. (`if`, `and`, `or`, `not`, etc.)
* You may use comparison operators. (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `is`, etc.)
* You may use iterators. (`while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`)
* You may NOT store any variables. (`=`)
* You may NOT access any instance variables directly. (`self._anything`)
* You may NOT use any Python libraries or class methods. (`sorted()`, etc.)
* You may define robot helper methods, as long as they follow all the rules.
